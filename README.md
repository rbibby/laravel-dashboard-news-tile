Displays latest news on your Laravel Dashboard using newsapi.org

This tile can be used on [the Laravel Dashboard](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-dashboard).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require rbibby/laravel-dashboard-news-tile
```

## Configuration

In the `dashboard` config file, you must add this configuration in the `tiles` key. 

The `api-key` option should contain your API key from https://newsapi.org/. It is recommended this is set in an env variable.

The `country-code` option sets which country to list news from. For a list of valid country codes, see the [newsapi.org.uk documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)

The `number-of-articles` option determines how many articles to show on the dashboard.

The `refresh-interval-in-seconds` option determines how many seconds will pass before the dashboard tile is re-rendered.

```php
// config/dashboard.php

return [
    // ...
    'tiles' => [
        'news' => [
            'api-key' => env('NEWS_API_KEY'),
            'country-code' => 'gb',
            'number-of-articles' => 10,
            'refresh-interval-in-seconds' => 60,
        ],
    ],
];
```

In `app\Console\Kernel.php` you should schedule the `\RBibby\NewsTile\FetchDataFromApiCommand` to run. You can let it run every minute if you want. You could also run it less frequently if fast updates on the dashboard aren't that important for this tile.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // ...
    $schedule->command(\RBibby\NewsTile\FetchDataFromApiCommand::class)->everyMinute();
}
```
## Usage

In your dashboard view you use the `livewire:news-tile` component.

```html
<x-dashboard>
    <livewire:news-tile position="e7:e16" />
</x-dashboard>
```

## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
